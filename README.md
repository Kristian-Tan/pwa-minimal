# Minimal PWA

## About
- minimal (least amount of code) to make a web application qualify as installable PWA
- no frills (css, js, library, framework), just plain old html and javascript (also some image/png/jpg for mandatory icon)
- the goal is to show the bare minimum to be installable by chrome/chromium (specification might be changed later, so it should work around last commit date)
- because it's minimal, it WILL violate many best practice for PWA
